# Multiply-Division-Unit
Multiply-Division-Unit of ALU for RISC-V M-extention 32bit
The aim of this project is to implement an hardware unit capable to perform multiplications and divisions inside a general purpose microprocessor, according to RISC-V specifications.
Digital arithmetic is nowadays well-known and implemented in various applications and products. 
After technology scaling has become slower, the need of more advance technology in terms of performances, energy consumption and occupied area brought more focus on the development of better architectures.
The strength of the major companies in the area of general purpose microprocessors stands mostly here.
This project doesn't want to compete in the market, but to propose a valid implementation from algorithms studied in classroom. 
This is a first try to realize something that is slightly more than an academic exercise. 
While almost all algorithms are well described in literature and papers, implementation issues are left to hardware designers, especially when there's the need to work with different number format in the same architecture. 
The report aim is to describe the project itself and all the problem found and solved, and motivate all the choices taken during the whole design flow.
